# Cryptopals Hypothesis

After reading Jacob Kaplan Moss's [Getting started with py.test](https://jacobian.org/writing/getting-started-with-pytest/), I thought "well, I know [py.test](http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/) pretty well, but I have been struggling to put [Hypothesis](http://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to use" and decided to give it a shot, using the [Cryptopals Crypto Challenges](https://cryptopals.com) as a means to an end.

A blog post about this might come later.
